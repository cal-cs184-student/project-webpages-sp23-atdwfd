        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, we chose to implement parts one and two. In part one, Mirror and Glass Materials, we worked
            on implementing reflection and refraction on the spheres in our scene, as well as how this would work with
            glass to make things look more realistic. In part 2, Microfacet Material, we worked on implementing reflections
            to give the look of different materials with varying roughness.

        <p>
            At max_ray_depth = 0, we only see the light source at the top of the scene. This shows only the light coming
            straight into the camera. At max_ray_depth = 1, we can now see a lot more of the scene. We are able to see
            much of the walls and the light that directly hits the surface of the spheres, as there is a little bit of
            glare on them. At this stage, we cannot clearly see the ceiling or its corners. At max_ray_depth = 2, we can
            now see a nice reflection in the left sphere, but the ceiling in it looks like the render before it, and colors of
            the walls on the right sphere. We can also more clearly see the ceiling and its corners. At max_ray_depth = 3,
            we now see light coming through the right sphere, and see a lit ceiling in the left sphere. The right sphere
            is still black in the view of the left sphere. At max_ray_depth = 4, the right sphere is no longer black in
            the left sphere. At max_ray_depth = 5 and max_ray_depth = 100, we don't see much difference from max_ray_depth = 4,
            however we can see that the glares coming through and presented on the right sphere are becoming visibly brighter.

            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            These bounce numbers relate directly to the effects that appear at each step. When we have zero bounces, we
            are only seeing light that comes straight into the camera. The only light that does this is that which comes
            straight from the light source, which is why that is the only lit portion when max_ray_depth = 0. With one more
            bounce, we can now see the light that directly hits objects and walls. This is why we see glare on the spheres,
            that then comes to the camera, but no other light from them. This is also why we cannot see the
            ceiling - there is no light from the source directly hitting it. With two bounces, we can now see
            a lot more light on the spheres, as we now see the light not only directly hitting them, but also the light
            landing on them from the walls.
            With one more bounce, we see a lot more light from the right sphere,
            including some light coming through it onto the ground. This is because we have enough bounces to bounce
            through the sphere onto the floor at this point, which is why with one more bounce, we can see the light from
            the floor reflecting back on to the sphere, and we now see glare on the top and bottom of the right sphere.
            With more bounces, we see diminishing returns, but as we would expect, since more light bounces back and forth,
            the glare spots become a little brighter, as mentioned before.

            Alpha represents the roughness of the material. As alpha increases, the material of the dragon seems to diffuse more and have less of a gloss. It is also noticeable lighter the more it increases, and the noisy dots decrease as alpha increases. At .25, the dragon gets the yellowish highlights it did not have before, and the dark reflection is minimized. At .5, it looks like the dragon has an almost rough texture, far from the mirror-like texture that is shown when alpha = .005. The more alpha increases, the more it is a metal reflecting light, rather than a mirror.

        <h3 align="Left">Working with a partner</h3>
        <p> Working on this project together was an enjoyable experience, although this was the first one where we didn't
            have a good chance to meet up to work together due to scheduling issues. Because of this, much of our work was
            done asynchronously, but we did consult each other when running into any bugs. We find that together makes it
            a lot easier to digest new material, as you have someone to consult if you're confused about anything or someone
            to potentially correct any misconceptions you might have about a topic.
