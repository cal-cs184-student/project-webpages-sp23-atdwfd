    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In the first part of this project, we focused on Bezier curves and implementing the de Casteljau algorithm. After doing this we could run a Bezier curve in meshedit and visualize it, along with control points. After this, in part two, we adapted our code to also work with Bezier surfaces. This allowed us to visualize bez files, like a teapot, on screen. In the third part, we implemented area-weighted normal vectors at vertices in order to have better shading for smooth surfaces. In later parts, we worked with implemented edge flips and edge splits to make different changes to our triangle mesh and visualize them. In the final part, we used our implementation of flips and splits in order to upscale our triangle meshes.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


    <p>
        De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that renders Bezier Curves. While it is slower than similar algorithms, because of the length of each step, it is more numerically accurate. In our implementation, we began with the base case of the one step, which was when there was only one point being passed in. Then, we found the value of linearly interpolating the point p[i] with p[i+1] as mentioned in lecture. This is one of the steps of the De Casteljau algorithm. It is slow because every recursive call has a for loop for every point.
    </p>
    <br>


    <p>
        We created a Bezier curve with the following points: 0.200 0.350   0.300 0.600   0.900 0.450

    <p>
        In essence, applying the De Casteljau's algorithm several times allows you to handle Bezier surfaces. It must, however, be applied in layers. To evaluate the entire Bezier patch, we wrote evaluate, which finds the result of de Casteljau's algorithm for a vector of points for each control point with scalar parameter u, then does the same for the resulting points with scalar paramet v. To find the result of the algorithm for a vector of points, we recursively call evaluate1D on the result of evaluateStep(points) and given scalar t until there is only one remaining point, which would be the fully interpolated point. EvaluateStep is explained in part 1.

    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
        In part three, we implemented Vertex::normal(), which enables Phong shading by implementing area-weighted normal vectors at vertices. The normal function is called upon a vertex and it returns an approximate unit normal at that vertex. We did this by first finding an initial halfedge then looping through the subsequent half edges, taking positions along the way and creating a sum of all the area-weighted normals until we hit the same starting half edge. At the end, we normalize this sum and return the vector.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
    <b>
        Implementing the edge-flip operation, while relatively repetitive code, took a strong understanding of the edges,
        vertices, half-edges, and twins. We began by drawing out each edge in manually, writing out where reassignments
        should lie after the flip is completed. Then, closely following the CMU reference sheet given in the spec, we began
        by assigning the 9 halfEdgeIters we were interacting with. Then, we accessed the 4 vertices through the relevant
        half edges, as well as the edges themselves. Then, we set the two faces â€” one from the original halfedge and
        one from its twin. Finally, using the diagram we had initially drawn out, we began setting the neighbors of
        each of the halfedges, as well as switching the halfedges of each of the aforementioned elements of the mesh.

        Our debugging journey:
    </b>
    <p>
        Debugging this task was relatively difficult, primarily because it was really hard to tell what the
        issue was when the flip didn't look right. We ran into a problem where the edge was significantly darker
        after the flip, as if it was taking the color from the shaded part of the teapot. After redoing our logic,
        and resetting the neighbors, it worked properly.
    </p>
    <br>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
        Similar to our process for edge splits, we began by using the same diagram as before. This time, however,
        we only inserted an edge in the middle. After inserting the edge on our own diagram, we noted that this
        operation needs 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 6 new half-edges. We wrote out where exactly
        each of these elements would need to be inserted and what the neighbors of existing half-edges would
        need to be set to. We did not set any of the isNew variables here, which led to a few issues while debugging.

    <b>
        Our debugging journey:
    </b>
    <p>
        This problem was quick for us â€” after having to debug flip extensively, the logic behind split was already there.
    </p>
    <br>

    <br>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>

    <p>
        We followed the spec closely for the entirety of upsampling. We began by iterating through every
        vertexIter of the given mesh, and setting 'isNew' to 'false' to prepare for the upcoming split.
        Then, we found u & n variables based on the given equation and given elements,
        and added up all of the positions of the neighbors. This part of the problem was the
        the part that ended up being our primary issue when debugging. Based off the lecture,
        we had begun the loop as the halfedge, not the halfedge's twin, and were similarly iterating through the neighbors.
        This was leading to an issue where corners were not being set to the new position. After
        trial and error, we found that we had to start at the twin and iterate through the twins of the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
        After calculating the new positions of the current vertex and setting the currVertex->newPosition, we went on to do the same to
        the edges of the mesh. Using the given formula, we found the neighboring positions that
        were relevant by accessing the edge itself, its twin, the next->next of the original edge, and the
        next->next of the twin. Then, using these, we calculated the new position of the current edge. This was also
        where we stored the edges to be accessed in the next for loop to be split.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, using the aforementioned array of edges, we iterate through the old edges and begin
        calling the split method we implemented earlier. Saving the returned VertexIter from the split
        edge function, we used that vertex to set the isNew variables of the surrounding half edges. In hindsight,
        it was likely more intuitive to have implemented this in split edge itself, but this was fully functional.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, we iterated through all of the edges, checking the conditions of if (1) the edge was new and
        (2) the edge connecting an old and new vertex. If it was, the edge was flipped. Finally, we copied the vertex
        newPosition into the position parameter of each vertex.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our primary method of debugging this function was using cout to output where in the code we
        were getting stuck in forever loops. We also outputted positions to begin debugging the
        specific points in which the image was incorrect.
    </p>

    <p>
        After loop subdivision, sharp corners and edges in meshes become evened out, and are close to unnoticeable after enough steps. In the above images, with the cube in the top left, we can see that what was one a typical cibe, with eight sharp edges, has become an almost spherical object after loop subdivision. The same thing can be said for the icosahedron on the bottom left. The two images on the right show that it is possible to preserve sharper edges after loop subdivision. This was done by presplitting edges near these sharper parts, which helped keep those points and edges more distinct after subdividing.

    <p>
        After loop subdivision, the cube becomes slightly asymmetric. The effect is clear in the series of images above. At each level of subdivision, we can see a scew towards the bottom right and top left of the cube, which wasn't originally there in the first image of the cube with no subdivision.

    </p>
    <p>
        This is something that can be attenuated with pre-processing, making edge flips and splits before subdividing to help the cube subdivide symmetrically. Preprocessing helped to alleviate these affects in ways similar to how we were able to preserve the sharp edges of figures in the section above. If we make changes to the triangle mesh that are counteracting the trend towards the top left and bottom right, then the mesh can become evened out when it subdivides. Pre-processing through splitting and flipping is clearly a powerful tool that can be utilized to change the way subdividing changes our mesh.
